Kanayev Azamat Problem 1 Midterm on 27 of April

```{r}
us=read.table("~/UBSprices.txt")
```

1a
i. Key diference that above line we see observations of 2009 rice prices after recession.
Below regression line we see observtions of 2003 rice prices as rule. There is one exception 
rice price of Mumbai was higher in 2003 than in 2009.

```{r}
fit2=lm(us$rice2009~us$rice2003)
summary(fit2)
```


```{r}
plot(us$rice2009~us$rice2003)
abline(fit2)
```

ii. Vilnus has the largest increase in rice price. London has the largest deacrease in in rice price.

iii. We removed 2 possible outliers just above 70 and between 60 and 70 values in Y axis

```{r}
us=read.table("~/UBSprices-v3.txt")
fit3=lm(us$rice2009~us$rice2003)
summary(fit3)
```

SLR Model
y=2.864 + 0.997X
beta1 is not equal 0 (p val ~ 0) - we conclude that linear relationship between X and Y

```{r}
boxplot(us$rice2003, horizontal = TRUE, xlab = "Prices 2003", main = "(d) Box Plot")
```

```{r}
#resid vs predictor x
#par(mfrow=c(1,2))
us.res = resid(fit3)
us.fit=fitted(fit3)
plot(us$rice2003, us.res, ylab="Residuals", xlab="Rice price of 2003", main="Rice prices 2003")
abline(0, 0)

#resid vs fitted value
plot(us.fit, us.res, ylab="Residuals", xlab="Fitted Values",
     main="Rice prices 2003")
abline(0, 0)
```

After removing possible outliers we still can see variability (range 17-25)

```{r}
us_stdres = rstandard(fit3)
qqnorm(us_stdres, ylab="Standardized Residuals", xlab="Normal
       Scores",main="Rice prices 2003")
qqline(us_stdres)
```

From QQ plot we see deviation from normality of residuals. Residuals are not normal from shapiro test p val<0.05

```{r}
shapiro.test(us_stdres)
```

```{r}
library(MASS)
boxcox(us$rice2009~us$rice2003)
```

lambda = -0.5 we need transform of Y_i=1/sqrt(Y)

```{r}
y=us$rice2009
x=us$rice2003
y1=1/sqrt(y)
plot(y1~x)
fit4=lm(y1~x)
abline(fit4)
```

We see the result - variability is decreased. We significantly reduced non-normality of residuals we get. We that residuals now are normal from Shapiro test

```{r}
us_stdres1 = rstandard(fit4)
qqnorm(us_stdres1, ylab="Standardized Residuals", xlab="Normal
       Scores",main="Rice prices 2003")
qqline(us_stdres1)
```

```{r}
shapiro.test(us_stdres1)
```
